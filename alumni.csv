1,Fran,Etter,franetter@gmail.com,0,,,,,,,Belleville High School District 201 - SIU Carbondale,Spanish/English high school teacher,"I received my BS in Secondary Education with a double major in English and Spanish at SEMO.  I graduated in 1989.  I then graduated with my MA in English - Teaching of Writing from SIU Edwardsville in 1993.  And then I graduated from SIU Carbondale with my PhD in Curriculum and Instruction - Teacher Leadership in 2005.  Whew!   I began teaching English and Spanish at Columbia HS in Columbia IL in 1989, and then I moved to Belleville West High School in Belleville, IL in 1991 where I have been ever since teaching Spanish and English.","BS in Secondary Education with a double major in English and Spanish.  I began as an elementary education major, but after a few observations in the local grade schools to fulfill a requirement in an Introduction to Education course, I knew that I would better serve older students.  I always had an interest in writing, and I felt semi-confident with my ability to pick up a second language.  After meeting with my counselors at SEMO, it was decided that I would pursue the BS in Secondary Education and work my way through the coursework for the double major in English and Spanish, which was a very good idea, as it made me very marketable when I graduated!","My brother had lived and worked in Cape Girardeau for many years, and I was looking to get away from my home in Germantown, IL at a comfortable distance from my parents!  ",I was very much influenced by accomplished instructors such as Dr. Dale Haskell in the English Dept. and Dr. Leon Book in the Foreign Languages Dept.  They were hip instructors at the time and very enthusiastic about their subject matter.  They thought outside the box and really ignited my passion for creativity in teaching.  They saw something in me that helped me to gain the confidence I needed to be successful both academically and professionally.  ,"I really just enjoyed being in the classroom with my classmates.  The class sizes were small, and I was able to get to know others rather comfortably.  I did not take many opportunities to engage in social activities other than Spring Fling, but I do not regret this at all.    I worked in the Academic Hall in the Purchasing Dept. under Teresa Bauer, and she really became like a mother to me throughout my years at SEMO.  I am indebted to her as well.    I also remember well sitting in Dr. Peter Hilty's classroom and just being touched by the way that he would read poetry aloud to us and sometimes have to hold back his tears because he was so swept up in the passion of the words.  I gained a huge respect for literature from Dr. Hilty.  Oh...and Dr. Crowley in the Foreign Languages Department.  Wow...she was a hoot.  Never a dull moment with her around.  I can always remember her running down the hallway to call for Dr. Book...""Dr. Libro...Dr. Libroooo!"" (in Spanish).","Well, I guess that would have to be my PhD.  I never fathomed the idea that I could go that far in my studies.  Getting my PhD has opened up many opportunities for me to teach at the university level, which I currently do for SIU Carbondale, and carry out many leadership and professional responsibilities in my school district.  ","College is doable, even if you have to pay for all of it on your own, which is what I did.  People at SEMO do take an interest in you and want to see you succeed. ",friendly affordable unforgetable,"In secondary education, I think it is important to consider multiple certifications.  Having multiple endorsements opens up many opportunities for you.  If you are in an area outside of the core courses (World Languages, Music, Art, PE, etc.), it is definitely worth your time to take the extra courses for endorsements in the core curriculum.

10,Addie,Scoggin,addiescoggin@gmail.com,2016,1305 Hwy 32 ,,Park Hills ,Missouri ,63601,United States,Ministry of Education of United Arab Emirates,English Graduate Teacher,"Initially, I began my masters degree so I could teach American students writing, but over time, I realized I was gravitating my focus towards international students; I yearned to know more about their culture and lifestyle. I was quickly enamored by their lively spirit and transnational learning styles. I reciprocated their curiosity. Now, having left America, my new home for next two years is the United Arab Emirates; here, I will teach English to both Arabic and Expat high school students.","English: Writing was my major.   It was a hard decision because I listened to the common misconception that ""language arts degrees are useless and unreliable."" Thankfully, I asked around before ruling out English. Those who graduated with an English degree were living stable and sucessful lives.  Not to mention, in my experience, that stereotype couldn't be more incorrect. I've landed a great job as Writing Lab Coordinator at a community college and even interviewed for many teaching positions. This major was invaluable; without it, I'm not sure how else I would fit into the world. ","First of all, many of my high school teachers and community college instructors graduated from Southeast. When I was searching for schools, I called upon my own teachers to help me find the perfect institution to fit my career goals. Because I was interested in teaching and English, I was guided towards Southeast. Witnessing my own teachers' passion and respect for Southeast drove me to Cape Girardeau. I knew that if I loved the school and got involved academically and socially, it would fit.  ","Thank you will never be enough. Dr. Missy Phegley from the English department was the most influential instructor I've ever had.  During my time as a undergrad and graduate student, Missy has been my teacher, counselor, guide, and friend. She genuinely cared to know that I was developing not only professionally, but personally. For that, I owe her many thanks. ","One memorable moment stands out during my more impressionable undergrad years.   In Relational Communication Strategies class, back in 2013, Dr. Jennifer Summary, who I adored with all my heart, had just assigned every student a 45 minute lecture/presentation to be delivered to our class (of about 35 or more students). I was petrified. We had about a month to prepare, but this was my first exposure to classroom-like lectures of advanced content. This was my chance to act all ""instructor-y."" Almost every other night, I worked on my presentation outline so it was perfect. The day of my presentation, I was already battling underarm sweat stains just walking to class. My performance as a ""poser-teacher"" came and went. I felt satisfied with myself simply because it was over, but it was the encouraging words of Dr. Summary that nailed down my passion to teach ""Great job with definitions and examples, very conversational yet relaxed, AND you would make a fantastic instructor at the college and/or university level--shoot me an email if you want to learn more about teaching in higher ed."" Her personalized feedback and willingness to reach out confirmed my desire to teach. I have held on to her feedback jotted down on that rubric ever since. I revisit it often. ","Upon graduating with my masters, I quickly landed a full time job at Mineral Area College as the Writing Lab Coordinator.  As a young professional, emphasis on young, I was shocked. I don't know why, but for some reason, I didn't expect to gain full time for several more years. I expected to work tirelessly for years, crawling up the ladders. ","Life is bigger than just the Midwest. Before Southeast, my dream was to become an English teacher living a small-town life in Missouri. Not that there is ANYTHING wrong with this lifestyle, I just didn't know there were other options. I took advantage of the diverse and culturally-educated faculty and learned more about the world.  Because of this, I felt equipped to live and teach in Dubai, UAE.","Stimulating, lively, warm ","You will hear ""English degrees are impractical."" Prepare for this. Even my dearest friends and family said this, and coming from them, I almost switched majors, except I didn't know what else I'd do without English. Writing was my existence.   So, let the criticism of ""useless and impractical"" degree talk bounce off. While STEM majors are great, and I truly believe that, not everyone belongs in a technical career.   Liberal Arts and Sciences, Foreign Languages, Literature, and Linguistics and Humanities ARE worth it.

Hayden Island Drive,210,Portland,OR,97217,United States,Retired,Speech-Language Pathologist; Early Childhood Special Educator,"At graduation I was unsure if I wanted to teach English or provide speech-language therapy. I worked for one school year in the Jackson R-2 School District while my husband finished his degree at SEMO. A move to Phoenix, Arizona, solidified my choice of Speech-Language Pathology. Since I had already completed some dual enrollment classes I returned to SEMO to complete my Master's degree during summer sessions. I graduated from SEMO again in 1978. It was one of the best decisions of my life. Throughout a 40+ year career I was able to explore many venues as a professional. My professional choice allowed me to work in many areas: early childhood, developmental disabilities, neuro-motor disabilities, evaluation and assessment, and most recently - Autism Spectrum Disorders. While I primarily worked in the public school system I also maintained a private practice; provided consultation; worked in clinical settings; and taught extension classes for Northern Arizona University. ","My undergraduate degree is in Education, but  'speech correction' evolving into Speech Pathology was my major field of study. In 1967-68, freshmen were required to attend a number of convocations led by guest speakers and professors. M.G. Lorberg, the head of the department, presented on communication disorders. He talked about the incredible ability human beings possess to process language and speak or communicate. He explained  how some individuals have impairments or difficulties or delays affecting this 'natural' phenomenon, natural but infinitely complex. I was intrigued and decided to make the field my area of study.","I was fortunate to receive a Regent's Award to attend any of the Missouri state colleges. I briefly considered the University of Missouri at Columbia, but at 17, found its size intimidating. SEMO was the right size, the right distance from home in St. Louis, and the right price. There were also a number of my high school classmates attending that fall so my decision wasn't difficult.","This is a tough question. There were many influences during my undergraduate years and they were of varying degrees in both positive and negative veins. I believe that's normal during 'coming of age' stages. Dr. John B. Long was a kind and thoughtful professor who awarded me a graduate assistantship following my graduation in 1971.  He was an accomplished professional, holding national certifications in both speech pathology and audiology. He guided me toward pursuing the Master's degree. During graduate school - I was very much influenced by Dr. Mary Ann Vogelsang nee Trombetta. She sat on my thesis committee and was my clinical advisor/supervisor. She was articulate, brilliant, and motivating. ","There isn't a 'best' college memory. I enjoyed campus life, participating in a sorority and serving in the Student Senate. The cultural sea change occurring during my undergrad years was remarkable. 1967 - co-eds couldn't wear pants or shorts on campus before 4 P.M. By 1970, the fashion of jeans and tee shirts was totally acceptable (not in the communication disorders clinic!). On campus dorms and sorority houses observed curfews for women students until the 'key card' system was instituted in the fall of 1970. I loved  downtown Cape with the Main Street shops. I loved the surrounding area, Trail of Tears State Park, Cape Rock, and lovely Capaha Park and its rose garden. I met my husband of 47 years the summer of my junior year and even though I nearly drowned on our second date, floating down the Current River, meeting and marrying him has to take top prize.","My professional accomplishments aren't necessarily within the sphere of awards or citations or notoriety. They include the best fruits of my profession: facilitating communication among those who are limited in those skills. The successes of my clients and students and relationships with them, their families, and my colleagues are my legacy. It's notable that my only daughter-in-law, my daughter of the heart, earned a Liberal Arts degree from a private midwestern university in 1997. She discovered speech therapy through our relationship and attained her Master's degree in Speech-Language Pathology in 2004. Being a Speech-Language Pathologist remains key to my identity despite retirement in 2015. Loving what I did is the greatest accomplishment anyone could desire.",The most important thing I learned relative to my profession: You will never 'know' everything. Ask questions. Do your research. Keep learning.  The most important thing I learned relative to life: persistence.,Learning for Life,"Speech-Language Pathology is a wonderful profession. Look at social media pages such as Speech Pathologists at Large on Facebook for some insights. Talk to working professionals. Research areas of specific interest since the field has become so varied: public school therapy, clinical therapy for pediatrics, geriatrics, rehab facilities, Autism, voice therapy, feeding therapy, and so on. Does SEMO offer courses and clinical experiences that match your interests? And perhaps most importantly - check on salaries in the professional and geographical areas in which you desire to work. Will the burden of educational loans or cost be adequately met on those salaries? I believe SEMO continues to offer an affordable university education. With the exorbitant costs of a university education this is a critical concern.",https://semo.wufoo.com/cabinet/d461fc5c-c4b7-42c4-a848-e570b9c5bccb,6/12/2018 21:58,public,,,24.21.80.174,1,1

I looked for job opportunities within my company that utilized my scientific background, but let me learn and develop other skills.   As such, I moved into roles in Compliance, Product Management and Sales, as well as complemented my undergraduate Biology degree with an MBA.  I have spent much of the last 10 years of my career focused in leadership roles in Sales and Marketing in the Biotech/Biologics space.  Earlier this year, I joined a company that is focused on cell therapy as their Global Sales Director.","I majored in Biology at Southeast, with minors in Chemistry and Environmental Science.  I always loved science (did many science camps as a kid!), and I originally believed I would pursue a career in medicine.  However, I did an internship the summer before my senior year in a laboratory at the company I would end up working for after graduation.  I saw that I could actually mix science and business and have many career options available to me in the future.","There were many reasons that I chose Southeast.  First and foremost was the quality of the education that I knew I would receive.  I loved the campus, and Cape Girardeau was a very welcoming town for this girl who was a little scared to leave home.  I also saw it as an amazing overall value based upon the reasonable tuition and generous scholarships available - I was actually awarded the Governor's Scholarship, which cemented Southeast as the perfect choice for me.  ","I think the two professors that had the most impact on me were Dr. Bruce Hathaway, who I had for Organic Chemistry I/II, and Dr. John Kraemer, who I had for most of my Environmental Science sources.  Dr. Hathaway always made learning fun - who knew Organic Chem could be FUN?  And Dr. Kraemer really opened my eyes to the wealth of career opportunities that exist for scientists in industry.  So grateful to them and all of the talented faculty that I had the opportunity to learn from in my time at Southeast.","I have so many memories that involve the amazing ladies that I lived with on the 6th floor of Towers North, who remain some of my best friends today.  Possibly my favorite was when we had a snow/ice storm during finals week, and we went sledding down the hills that surrounding the field that used to be by the Towers Complex (I believe it is a parking garage now).  We had a blast playing out there for hours like little kids!","I believe it is the multiple opportunities I have had to lead talented teams of people.  For me, there is no greater honor or responsibility that a role that involves motivating, mentoring and helping others to succeed.  Though I never want to see my team members leave, I am so proud when I see them moving on to bigger and better career or life opportunities!","I learned who I was!  The supportive environment at Southeast - from the friends that I made, to the professors that I learned from, to the different activities available that allowed me to develop and stretch different skills - helped me really start to understand what I wanted from my future and from my life.  I was never really shy or introverted before, but my time at Southeast gave me a greater confidence to embrace and be proud of who I was and what I was capable of achieving.",motivating transformative supportive,"First of all - go for it!  There are SO many opportunities for graduates with a scientific degree.  Know that there are many options available to you - just because you have a chemistry degree or a biology degree doesn't mean that you have to do experiments at a lab bench.  There are opportunities in business, medicine, pharmacy, law, etc.  that allow you to utilize your scientific background in unique ways.  And explore internships!

I served as an Audiologist in the United States Air Force for seven and a half years.  I was stationed at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, Royal Air Force Lakenheath in the United Kingdom, and Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma.  Currently, I work as an Audiologist in a private practice in Cambridge, United Kingdom and have recently rejoined the United States Air Force as a Reservist.","My major was Communication Disorders.  I was interested in hearing loss and helping people.  Once I found audiology, I knew that is what I wanted to do.","I am originally from Kansas City, Missouri and wanted to find a school far enough away from home that I felt 'on my own', but not so far that I could not go home.  I also wanted to do something completely different from everyone else in my high school.  I found Southeast and it seemed the perfect fit.  Not to mention, I got an academic scholarship, so that helped.","This is too hard to narrow down to one or two people, but I can narrow it down to one or two groups.  I was a cheerleader and a member of Delta Delta Delta, having both of those groups of people to work with helped in so many ways.  Being a part of the Greek community was amazing and led to meeting wonderful people.  Having cheerleading as a outlet and friends to share it with, was something I am so glad was a part of my college career.","I think I have three:  winning Greek Week, cheering at the NCAA Basketball Tournament, and graduating Magna Cum Laude. ",My greatest professional accomplishment would be serving in the United States Air Force.  I am so honored to have served my country.  ,"I am from a small town and had been friends with the same people all my life.  Although, most of my friends stayed in that small town, even if they did attend college, I left.  It was hard because when I returned, I was no longer a part of that life.  Being at Southeast, I made new friends.  In fact, I speak to my SEMO friends more than I do my home town friends and that is ok.  I learned just because that is the way it has always been, does not mean you cannot grow and change.  I learned that my friends from my past, were just that, my past.  My Southeast friends were my current and my future.  I did not want to be that small town girl for the rest of my life, I wanted to see the world.  I needed people in my life that felt the same, or at least encouraged my dreams to, and at Southeast, I found them.",,"Be prepared to work.  Communication Disorders is a tough major.  If you are like me and want to be an Audiologist, stick with it.  The program is very Speech-Language Pathologist driven, but grin and bear it through those parts, because it will be worth it in the end. If you would like to pursue a career in the military, do not be afraid.  If you would have told me when I was at Southeast, three short years later I would be a Captain in the United States Air Force, I would have laughed.  I never thought I could do something like that, but I did.  Do not rule out any opportunity and never underestimate yourself.

I graduated with my J.D. in 2010. I was lucky enough to move back to Cape Girardeau after graduation and joined Bradshaw, Steele, Cochrane and Berens. I passed the Missouri and Illinois bar exams on my first attempts and stayed in private practice until 2014.  In the spring of 2014, I started the application process to join the Department of Justice as an assistant United States attorney. I hoped to join the office in Cape Girardeau, but no positions were available at that time. I was offered a position in the Southern District of Illinois and started on July 14, 2014.   As an attorney in my office's civil division, I focus primarily on defensive civil litigation involving medical malpractice and civil rights. I handle a few criminal cases as my caseload allows. My work has allowed me to travel around the country for depositions and witness interviews, but most of my time is spent in the office, or in the federal courthouses in East St. Louis and Benton.","After starting in the business department, I moved to criminal justice after deciding that I wanted to work in law enforcement. I made the change because I wanted to be taking classes that related to my preferred career path (and because some of the math prerequisites for business were really, really hard).

Look for role models, sometimes do not look so far, just someone at a comparable range with you should do. Revisit your CV time and time again, then ask yourself ""How can I make myself more competitive? What skills and work experiences do I have to acquire to achieve this?""  Last but not least, be consistent. While very young, you may wish to switch careers but once you are in your late twenties or early thirties, you should have a definite idea of what you want your career to look like, unless of course you wish to be a self employed entrepreneur.

I quickly discovered, sales was not my cup of tea, and quickly regretted taking my first offer. Six months of living in Connecticut, I landed a job working for United Way of Connecticut for a small town. I helped budget their 1 million dollar budget, held 2 positions in the office, and led program coordination for events throughout the year. After holding this job for a few months, I took a 3rd position as a accountant for a small in home firm. That is where things led to my first ""real"" accounting job. Shortly after, I received an offer with MARS Chocolate. I moved to Kansas where I opened up their first Chocolate plant in several decades. I took the position as Sr. Cost Accountant and started to grow my career. I lead waste improvement projects on Snickers and MandM's manufacturing lines. I ate my weight in Chocolate, and learned a lot about corporate accounting and manufacturing accounting.   After 3.5 years in Kansas, I got a promotion in 2016 to Nashville TN to become a Sr. Financial Analyst for MARS Pet care. I helped lead a team of 7 Accountants, and 6 Manufacturing facilities in my time at Mars Chocolate. This in turn helped me guide the business in decisions on Co-manufacturing and Co-Packaging operations with major brand names like, Whiskas, Ol'Roy, Sheiba, Cesars, and Temptations in Nashville. After 8 months in Nashville, I received an offer from Bridgestone Americas Corporate office to join their Team.   Since then, I have led a team of 4 Controllers/ Cost Accountants through annual budgets of hundreds of millions of dollars. I've managed a total of 4 manufacturing facilities alone ranging all the way from Jacksonville FL, to Anoka MN. ",My Major at Southeast was Accounting. ,"Honestly, I had chose Southeast because of its reputation and many of my high school friends were planning on going. In total, 8 close friends decided on Southeast and that is what led me to Cape Girardeau. ","I actually have 2. my first one was one time at band camp ( as funny as this sounds, its true), our professor sat us down and said, ""I've been in this professional career for X amount of years, and I still don't know what i want to do"" and basically assured us, its okay not know what you want to do, but be sure you love what you are doing. That led me to choose a career that  I knew was something I loved to do, and that was Math.  My second, wasn't until I officially had changed my major to Accounting the spring semester of my Sophomore year. My Accounting professor, Roberta Humphrey. She pushed me to learn everything I could in that first semester in Accounting, and had an approach that truly helped me in my learning abilities. As crazy as it sounds, I loved going to that class. I knew it was gong to be hard, but it was a fun challenging kind of hard. I can honestly say, I never studied so hard for any other class in my entire life, until intermediate accounting 1 came along. ","One of my best college memories was living in the Dorms, and making so many friends, I couldn't keep track of names. One evening, during Finals week in December 2010, I decided to dress into a Gorilla suit and walk the campus. A few friends and myself included, made stops around all the major study areas, just to shed some laughter at a Gorilla trying to get a computer to work before finals.

Besides the program being so renowned, I loved being “away” at school but still being relatively close to home (90 miles). The campus is also beautiful, and the area offers so much to do. ","I had so many great professors, but the three that stick out in my mind are Mary Harriet Talbut in the Dept. of Ed. and Dr. Peter Froehlich and Ms. Evelyn Menz in the English Dept. ","There are too many to name, but I loved representing my school and dancing at football and basketball games as a Southeast Sundancer.","I’m proud of my twelve year career as an English teacher and am looking forward to year thirteen. I’m so proud to teach at my home high school and help shape the next generations of North County Raiders. One of my biggest goals is to make English relatable and fun for my students and to always let them know that I care about the people they become just as much as I care about their grades.  I’m the proud coach of the North County Raiderettes dance team. We are the current back-to-back overall Missouri Class  2A State Champions, hold nine state titles, and are currently 5th in the nation from the NDA High School National Championships. ",I felt so prepared to enter the field and felt (and still feel) that I received a very well-rounded education. The freedom I had with my electives while still pursuing my degree allowed me to explore and focus on other interests at the same time. ,"Balanced, Fun, Successful","Though the education field seems to change by the minute, I’ve found it’s also very cyclical. Learn from your professors, keep good notes, and take it all in. At times, it may feel like, “This is all going to change within three years,” but learn from it and gather that good base at Southeast; you’ll easily be able to manage the ebbs and flows.

49,Ruth Ann,Orr,ruthannorr@gmail.com,1981,946 Karau Lane,,Cape Girardeau,MO,63701,United States,La Croix Church,Missions Director,"Graduated with BS in Education in 1981. I taught 5 years, finished my Master's of Arts in Guidance and Counseling and worked as a counselor, psychological examiner, and SPED Process Coordinator for coming to Alma Schrader in 2002 as principal. I finished my Ed.D. through the University of Missouri/SEMO cooperative in 2013 and worked as adjunct faculty in the College of Education, filling various rolls.  During that time, I began serving on short-term mission teams in Belize, Central America where I helped conduct professional development inservice for the teachers in the Cayo and Belize districts of Belize. I did this during the summars of 2015-17 before retiring in 2018.   I recently took the position of Missions Director of La Croix Church in Cape Girardeau. I just returned from a short-term missions trip to Manzini, Swaziland, Africa where I visited the Care Point our church sponsors as well as several other Cape Points throughout the country. The goal is always to help the people of Swaziland develop their skill sets so they become the next generation leaders of their country. ","I originally started out as a Business Management major. However, during my sophomore year, I just didn't feel as if that was a good fit for me. My grades were fine...but my passion was not. When I switched majors to Elementary Education/Psychology, I immediately felt at peace and developed the passion for teaching and serving others that lasted my entire educational career.",I am a third generation Southeast Missouri State University attendee. Almost my entire family has chosen to get their initial degree from Southeast Missouri State...even though we have taken divergent paths professionally. It was a great choice for me.,"Most definitely my uncle, Dr. Fred Snider, who, at the time I attended SEMO, was chair of the Psychology Department. His commitment to excellence and his ability to communicate his subject matter at the collegiate level made me feel comfortable in asking questions while challenging me. Dr. Sheila Caskey was also a great influence as were Dr. Jerry Waddle and Dr. Ruth Ann Roberts when I was doing my graduate studies.","Having my dissertation committee review and hearing the words, ""Congratuations, Dr. Orr."" Those were words I did not believe I would ever hear.","After receiving my Ed.D., my greatest professional accomplishment is joining teachers across the nation to travel to Belize to work alongside the teachers of Belize. Pulling off a two week conference with teachers from across the United States and Belize is challenging...but amazing. The first time we meet face to face is two days prior to conducting our first general conference and break-out sessions. Not only are we the presenters...we are also the set up crew! But every minute of planning, every minute of service...it's absolutely worth it. I've made lifelong colleagues of both the US and Belizean teachers.   This experience led me to interview for and be appointed as the Missions Director for La Croix. Going to Africa was an amazing experience at both the individual and professional level. The reception of the people of Swaziland was so genuine...and the motivation of the people with whom we worked was beyond inspiring. To just be a small part of someone else's professional growth is exceedingly gratifying. And I have never come back from a trip that I am not humbled. ","To learn to take chances and to persevere. I came from a small town, and SEMO was intimidating to me at first. It was hard to feel connected at first. However, I learned you are as connected as you choose to be. I just needed to learn to take a little initiative.","Relational, professional, challenging","Be open. My first year out of SEMO, I did not get the teaching position I expected, but I took the one offered. My professional journey was not a straight trajectory...but I was always fortunate to have great mentors who suggested I might try a different degree or get another endorsement. I took that to heart...and I have never regretted pursuing avenues I had not originally considered.",https://semo.wufoo.com/cabinet/09fe22b1-02be-49e2-aa19-5f85d3adf119,8/6/2018 14:43,public,,,75.133.15.22,1,1

Years later in medical school I felt well-ahead of my classmates in the basics of biology and genetics.  I was also heavily involved in the music department which gave me what I consider a very well-rounded education. ,"I was an active member of Alpha Phi Omega which is a national service fraternity.  We made serving others fun and I still believe that when you take the time to help other people, you gain much more that what you give.  I made some great life-long friends in that organization.","I am a part owner of Iowa Eye Center.  We have over 60 employees.  We provide a great work environment and benefits for our employees.  By focusing on our employees and our office environment, we are able to produce a higher quality product for our patients.  I enjoy being a small business owner and making that kind of impact.   ","I learned the importance of having a balanced lifestyle.  There is a lot of burnout in medicine.  In general, the medical community is more disconnected than ever before and working harder than ever before.  Southeast taught me the value in being a part of a community, providing service to others, being a leader, and living a well-rounded life.  I now have a wife and 2 kids and that balance is important to us.",Valuable personal growth,Medicine is a great field as long as you are passionate about the type of medicine you practice.  I have always found eye surgery interesting and academically challenging.  People really value their vision.  Many patients tell me it is their most vital sense.  To be able to provide care for something so important to people is a powerful thing.  Too many people choose a career path that they enjoy but the demand for the service or product is not needed.

I was a news reporter and covered President Reagan, the first President Bush, and President Clinton. I met and interviewed 5 Arkansas governors and 3 Missouri governors, a Miss America, an Academy Award winning actress, and several big celebrities like Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood.

I then moved to Sioux City, IA to coach competitive cheerleading and dance full time at Briar Cliff University, an NAIA institution near the boarder of South Dakota. A move to South Dakota took me to the admission department at the University of South Dakota where I was able to, once again, rock my red and black wardrobe acquired through my years at Southeast. One more move brought me and my fiance to Dubuque, IA where I am now a senior admission representative for Loras College as well as the head cheerleading coach for the school. Throughout all of this time I have been fortunate enough to continue as a staff member for the National Cheerleaders Association and meet cheerleaders and coaches all over the country. ","Human Environmental Studies with an emphasis in Fashion Merchandising I also have minors in retain management, marketing management, hospitality management, and dance  The fashion merchandising program appealed to me because it combined my love for fashion with the very versatile sales and business side of the curriculum. I knew that was something that would appeal to a variety of employers both inside and outside of the fashion world. The opportunities to pick up additional minors in the business school allowed me to diversify my experience, as well. The dance minor may seem random, but I had studied dance from age three, so the opportunity to pick up additional training in something I love was perfect - and the river campus is gorgeous!","I originally looked at Southeast simply because it was close to home, but quickly fell in love with the school. The varieties of majors offered allowed me to study subjects I love, but also gain real, usable, lifelong skills. For me, the opportunity to continue cheerleaidng in college was also important, and, to this day,  I love the program at Southeast with all of my heart. The campus became home and my teammates, my family. ","I had wonderful professors at Southeast! My professors in my first year learning team really helped me start off college on the right foot and understand what was expected of me in college. The department my major was in was very small, so the relationships formed with those professors was very important and they remain influential to me in all of my career choices. Ms. Thompson, Dr. King, and Mrs. Moore were invested in my success and interested in my as a person. Dr. Dickson in the business school not only taught me about the business world, but supported me through the completion of my honors project and is still always friendly anytime I see him when I am back on campus. Hillary Peterson in the dance department challenged me and pushed me outside of my comfort zone. I am grateful for my experiences with all of these professors!",All of my best memories of college surround my time with the cheerleading squad. I will cherish my memories cheering on the Redhawks forever - especially the homecoming games where we got a chance to mingle and stunt with many of our alumni. My final season at Southeast our football team won the OVC conference championship and getting to be a part of that season is definitely my favorite memory of college. ,My greatest accomplishment is taking what I learned at Southeast and being able to turn my passion into a profession. ,"The world is so much bigger than me and my personal experience. Southeast taught me that, even though my voice matters, my perspective is simply mine. There are so many factors and so many ways to look at the world. Southeast taught me to look beyond myself and to learn from others. ",Home,"Build your resume.

64,Francisco,Perez,franciscojperez60@gmail.com,2008,1062 Chamboard Ln,,Houston,TX,77018,United States,Northern Trust,Sr Portfolio Manager,"I started my career as an Investment Analyst for an Investment Advisory firm shortly after graduating in 2010 with my MBA from Southeast, it was an entry level position that really taught me the nuts and bolts of the wealth advisory industry and allowed me to network and learn more about how to move up in the industry. After a few years there, I was able to move to a Trust company as a portfolio manager and equity analyst, doing investment research on select companies and managing client portfolios. In this role I was able to take a different approach from my previous employer, as I was in charge of making investment decisions for clients. In the meantime I completed the CFA program and became a Chartered Financial Analyst, a designation that is the standard of excellence in the wealth management industry. Building on my experience and the fact that i had just received my charter, in 2014, I made the jump to International Wealth Management where I currently act as a Sr Portfolio Manager, providing services to private clients in Latin America and the Caribbean.   I have been able to progress in my career, although it hasn't been without hard work and dedication as the wealth management industry is very competitive. From starting out as an analyst and taking a broader approach to managing assets, to taking a more focused approach being an equity analyst by analyzing companies, to becoming a client facing portfolio manager for international clients. Earning the CFA designation along the way really helped me progress rather quickly in my field.","My major at SEMO for my Bachelors was International Business Management. Growing up I always thought I would end up studying something in the field of medicine, however during my freshman year at SEMO after taking a few of the courses, I realized that it was not for me and the anxiety of not knowing what to study really kicked in. I then began researching for an alternative, I knew that I wanted to use my Spanish (which is my first language) and wanted a career that would allow me to work with many people from many different backgrounds. I talked to my adviser, some professors and even some students in the school of business, and what I found out was that SEMO had a fairly robust international business program with great study abroad offerings and a very interesting curriculum. I found out that SEMO partnered with many universities worldwide and that they offered programs during Fall, Spring and even summer. I declared my major as a Sophomore and ended up graduating in the Fall of 2008 after taking advantage of the study abroad program during the previous summer in which I completed a study abroad program in Germany for 6 weeks. I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed my academic tenure as an undergrad at SEMO.   Shortly after that I enrolled in the MBA program at Southeast, which I was told was one of the best in the country when it came to bang for your buck. The final years of my bachelors I took a few courses on investments and capital markets and I found that it was something that interested me quite a bit. I was able to graduate with an MBA from Southeast with a concentration in Finance in the Spring of 2010.  All my life I thought I would en up in medicine, however SEMO helped me realize that my true conviction lied in International Business and I thoroughly enjoyed my years in Cape Girardeau.","I actually chose to go to SEMO because I received a football scholarship. My background is a bit different than your regular student, I was born in Venezuela and moved to Miami, FL during my teenage years. Coming from such a background, it was hard to imagine that I would ever en up playing football at a university in Cape Girardeau, MO.   I took a tour of the university in the fall of 2003, met with an academic advisor and toured the university. What i liked the most about my visit was learning about the growth plans that were forthcoming for the university. Back then, there were plans to build new dorms, update the athletic facilities and even build a River Campus, all which came to fruition in the coming years. I had also never seen snow and it came down quite a bit during my first night in Cape Girardeau so I thought it was very neat. I think that attending SEMO was one of the best decisions of my life, I met some lifelong friends, explored the Midwest, travelled abroad and also met my future wife Erika Upchurch class of 2007. ","It is truly hard to select just one person as many people come to mind right away, from professors to advisers to students to teammates and coaches. If I had to narrow it down I would select 3 people:   Sharon Burgard, who was the athletics department academic adviser had a huge impact in my tenure at Southeast, her willingness to help student athletes was apparent right away, she helped me navigate and plan out my career path and helped throughout my tenure there. She would always be available, and would offer a helping hand with any issue we may have had. She genuinely cared for her students and always had their best interest at heart.   On the academic side I would mention Dr William Weber, an economics professor in the college of business. Dr Weber's classes were very spirited and his methods of teaching always made me think analytically which is something Im required to do every day in my line of work. I believe that I enjoyed his classes the most during my tenure at SEMO but we also developed a friendship outside the classroom as he was a big football fan. During my MBA program, I worked closely with Dr Weber to complete my thesis. This was thoroughly enjoyable and I believed we were both vested in the project, his willingness to help me and walk me throughout the research portion of the project was instrumental on its success.  Lastly, I would mention Mrs Joyce Hunter from Career Linkages. I came to see Mrs Hunter because one of my colleagues had mentioned that I should put together a resume since I was going to graduate fairly soon. I remember coming to her worried about the fact that I had nothing to put on my resume and really stressed out about finding a job after graduation, the timing wasn't that great as it was the Fall of 2008. She worked with me for a few weeks and made me realize the worth of some of the things that I had done in my past and how those translated into the real business world. We were able to create a resume that exceeded all of my expectations. Mrs Hunter was instrumental in helping me land an internship my senior year and ultimately helped me land a job a few months before I graduated with my MBA. She helped me become one of the few that had a full time job lined up before graduation and Im very grateful for that.  ","I think my best college memory was a moment during graduation in the fall of 2008. My entire family was in the stands, my grandparents had flown in from Venezuela to watch me graduate and I thought that was a very big deal. I wrote to Dr Ken Dobbins (Southeast's president at the time), whom i knew of from my football playing days and told him that i was very excited that they were coming. During the opening remarks and to my surprise, Dr Dobbins singled me out and asked me to stand up. He then gave a quick blurb about who I was and where I came from and spoke a bit about my athletic and academic career at SEMO. He then asked my entire family to stand up (we had a delegation of about 20 including immediate family, aunts, uncles, cousins and my wife's family) and told the congregation that my grandparents had flown all the way from Venezuela to watch their grandson graduate and asked the congregation to thank them. A moment that I will never forget and surely neither will they. ","My greatest accomplishment so far has been completing the CFA Charterholder program in 3 years. It is a designation that is the Standard for the wealth management industry, it requires taking 3 rigorous 6 hour tests 3 years in a row with each requiring about 300 hours of study time. It was a major time commitment and my wife and I definitely sacrificed many weekends but in the end it was a sacrifice that was well worth it as it has really helped me move up quickly in the industry. ","Like many students, I was living on my own for the very first time at SEMO, thousands of miles away from my family and in a different country from most of my non-immediate family. I was trying to keep up with a very demanding football schedule while getting good grades and trying to maintain a social life. All of this being a Venezuelan football player that had never lived in a small city and had never been so far from my family. I was an atypical college student to say the least, however, I was lucky enough to be able to surround myself with great people, a great circle of friends and mentors and even meet my wife! all making me embrace the whole experience.  I learned that even though you may be faced with a tough situation, focusing and embracing the positives will completely shape the outcome, something that I carry with me daily.","Supporting, Diverse, Complete","The wealth advisory industry, like many others is one where you have to ""pay your dues"" Very seldom do recent grads get hired to senior roles so focus on investment analyst roles at a bank or and investment advisory firm. Also, if you are willing to move it will open up your prospects quite a bit, as obvious as it sounds it is important to keep that in mind.  For current students, I would recommend getting involved with extracurricular activities that are tied to the industry. For example i was the Treasurer of the MBA Association and was involved with the Investment Club, something i was able to put on my resume with direct correlation to the industry. Lastly, and I cant stress this enough, is use the resources that the university has available for you. Career linkages can be a great tool for upcoming graduates and as Ive mentioned, the people that work there are stellar at what they do.

",Marketing and Communications Manager,"In Graduate School I studied Public Administration. As part of my requirements for Grad School, I was required to complete an internship. In the summer of 2017, I landed an internship with a nonprofit organization in the city of St. Louis called Downtown STL, Inc. I was the marketing intern for the summer. Towards the end of my internship, I was offered a full-time position as the Marketing Associate for the organization. This was a wonderful start for me as I was finishing up my Masters. The position allowed me to use both of my degrees. In undergrad, I majored in Corporate Communications and my Masters was in Public Administration. Doing marketing for a nonprofit allowed me to gain experience in both areas of study.  The Marketing Associate position allowed me to take what I had learned in the classroom and apply the content to everyday life. My job tasks were very wide in range, which exposed me to a variety of challenges and obstacles. I managed 6 separate social media accounts across various platforms. I helped create a series of events targeted at interns in the St. Louis region as a talent recruitment and retention tactic. I planned, promoted, and managed various events that our organization puts on, including a very popular summer time concert series in Downtown.  I held this title from September 2017 when I was hired until August of 2018. The Marketing Associate position had such a wide range of tasks, which I enjoyed. In August 2018 I was promoted to Marketing and Communications Manager, where I continue many of the same tasks and job duties as I did in the past, but I also take on more responsibility. I now oversee the organization's outsourced marketing and work with our agency of choice on making sure all of the organizations marketing and messaging needs are accounted for. ","I graduated in 2015 with my liberal arts degree. I majored in Corporate Communications and minored in Integrated Marketing. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do beyond graduation and I felt this particular major allowed me to develop a very wide range of skills that I would be able to use in a wide spectrum of industries. Verbal and written communication is applicable in just about every field and it was certainly an area I wanted to grow in.   After graduation, in 2015, I accepted a Graduate Assistant at Southeast as the Graduate Hall Director for Greek Housing. I studied Public Administration and in 2017 I graduated with my Masters. Not knowing what career path I wanted to take, the additional 2 years studying Public Administration and working as a Grad Assistant helped me develop my skills even further before entering the workforce.        ",I chose to attend Southeast because it was the perfect size campus for me and it was extremely affordable. My first impression was that the campus was very beautiful and lively. It seemed like there was a lot going on when I visited and the energy was positive. I had no doubt it was the right school for me.,"I have had several wonderful mentors throughout my time at Southeast. College is a time where people develop so many life skills. The people who are there to influence you, for better or for worse, really do shape you as an adult.  Dr. Bruce Skinner has been one of the most influential mentors in my young adult life. I met Bruce on my very first day of classes, in my very first class at Southeast. He was teaching the UI100 course to first year students. Initially, I was not a fan of him and did not look forward to having him as a teacher. I've told him this before, but I thought he was mean and intimidating. As the semester went on I quickly realized that nobody  cares more about students and the experience they have at Southeast than Dr. Bruce Skinner. As the then Director of Residence Life, he wanted (and still wants) every student to leave Southeast with a positive, campus and educational experience. Bruce taught me that the biggest part of learning is challenging yourself and your thinking. Bruce pushes students to see the best in themselves and to take on new experiences. I benefited in many areas of my life from Bruce as our relationship developed on campus over the next 6 years. Today, I still consider Bruce a mentor, but I also fortunate to call him my friend.","My best college memory was my involvement in Greek Life. I joined the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity my freshman year. I developed some of my closest friends and had some very positive experiences throughout my time in the Southeast Greek system. I enjoyed the leadership opportunities it presented to me, such as being the President and the Resident Assistant of my chapter. Even in Grad School I oversaw all of the Greek Housing as the Grad Hall Director.   An interesting thing about the Southeast Greek system is that I was able to develop relationships with many men and women from other Greek organizations. Working in the real world, I've come across many young professionals like myself who I met in college. There really is a special connection there. Whether our organizations were competing or collaborating, there is definitely a connection that many of us carry beyond graduating.","My greatest professional accomplishment is definitely the intern programs that we've started in St. Louis. These events are something I took the lead on as an intern and continues to be part of my job. We call the program ""STL Connects"" and we invite interns from all over the St. Louis region to attend. We solicit sponsorships from local Downtown restaurants and microbreweries to give the interns a taste of the Downtown St. Louis market. Our programming is focused on things to do in Downtown. Our goal is to expose interns, who come from all over the country and all over the world, to the St. Louis amenities so they might consider St. Louis as a place to live and work after they finish school. The programs have had very large turnouts and has been well received by the business community. It was exciting for me because as someone who just graduated, I can still relate to the college students.","Relationships are the most important thing in the world. How you treat people and how you carry yourself can have a tremendous impact on your success. As a young professional, the little success that I have had in my career have come because of the relationships that I've worked to develop. I learned this very early on at Southeast by getting involved in activities outside of the classroom and working with a very wide range of students.",Best Missouri School,"Get as much experience wherever or however you can.

I really enjoyed my early social studies classes at SEMO, particularly in political science. Once I began taking education courses with Dr. Fridley, I knew I was in the right major for me. ","SEMO was the perfect size - it had the feel of a big, spirited campus but was small enough to seem like I would have a lot of opportunities to get involved. It was only two hours from my home, which was important to me. Finally, the scholarship opportunities at SEMO are amazing, and my financial award played a big role in my decision. ","Two people - Michele Irby and Daryl Fridley! I had the privilege to serve on Student Government for four years. During my junior year, Michele Irby and I met weekly. She is an amazing role model. She constantly challenged me and the other members of Student Government to practice servant leadership and advocate for the needs of the student body first and foremost. When I had some tough decisions to make my senior year about whether to commit to Teach For America, Michele was one of the first people I turned to for advice.   Daryl Fridley influenced me tremendously in my decision to become a social studies teacher. More than anyone, he taught me why the social studies are essential in our high schools today. Dr. Fridley gave really honest, constructive feedback. This helped me become a better teacher in the long run. Today, I still plan lessons using the model Dr. Fridley taught me.

I saw an Event Coordinator position open at a nonprofit that provides services for adults with developmental disabilities. Growing up, my mom was a paraprofessional, so I always had a heart for this kind of work. I interviewed for the Events position, but was offered something entirely different! I've been with this nonprofit, Emmaus, for 4 years now. Through print, radio, television, social media and more I get to share the stories of the men and women we support and the Direct Support Professionals that are pouring their heart and soul into the lives of others. I've found my calling. ","My major at Southeast was in Mass Communications with a minor in Integrated Marketing. My focus was on on Advertising and I was part of the first advertising club on campus. I took a lot of classes in Film Production which has greatly impacted my work at Emmaus. Instead of using a third party to create videos, I was able to take my interviewing and camera knowledge to produce videos in-house and really save our donation dollars for more important person focused needs. ","I chose to attend Southeast because of the Mass Media program. In high school I told myself I always wanted to work at an advertising agency. I researched colleges and found that SEMO was ACEJMC accredited. That really made it stick out to me. I also found that a lot of schools were offering Marketing programs, but I wanted Advertising, not the business side as my Major. ","During my time at Southeast, I had a lot of courses with Dr. Kari Hollerbach. She had a lot of insights and knowledge about the mass communication world. She also had real-life projects to work on, instead of everything being an example from a textbook. I remember working on an actual campaign for the Southeast Bookstore and competing with other classmates during a client pitch. I still keep in touch with Dr. Hollerbach today, and she's helped me in my current career by allowing her students to work on a project for Emmaus. ","My favorite college memory was filming a short-film for my major. I had my fraternity help with the project. It was a short film about Bigfoot stealing a peanut butter and jelly sandwich from someone at lunch. Imagine this. Walking around campus, turning the corner to see a fraternity of guys acting as film crew and a man in a bigfoot costume running around. We even did the Scooby Doo where he went in and out of rooms with people following him only to all crash into each other at the end. It was a hysterically fun day. ","Outside of college, my greatest professional accomplishment is the awards I've been able to secure for my nonprofit organization. The work we do makes it easy, but my team was effectively tell others why we are deserving. We have been able to win many things in the past few years including, a Better Business Bureau Charity Seal and Torch Award, Missouri Association of Developmental Disability Service Providers Cutting Edge Innovation Award, Ladue News Charity Award Finalist, and many others. ","The most important thing I learned at Southeast is to go for it. There were so many opportunities to get involved on and off campus. Take the chance and you might find something you really enjoy, or something that you're really good at. I was hesitant to join Student Activities Council because I didn't know if I had what it took to live up to the standard. But I jumped in and did it, and I couldn't be more thankful for it because of where I'm at today. ",Rewarding. Experience. Motivating.,I highly recommend pursuing a degree in Mass Communications. It gives you the excitement to work on different projects throughout the year and it can be valuable with any business. Try a variety of things. Talk to the professors. They all have a huge network and years of experience in the field.,https://semo.wufoo.com/cabinet/9c897539-8c18-4348-ad42-d61764a30ed2,2/5/2020 9:08,public,,,71.91.220.251,1,1

Chris ,Decker,L.c.decker67@gmail.com,1989,2857 Milan St.,,Easton,Pa,18045,United States,Exxon Mobil Corporation,"Senior Researcher, Fuel and Lubricants Product Developement","Upon graduation 1989,  I spent 9 years working for Chemical Waste Management Inc. serving as a Chemist, Laboratory Manager and Facility Technical Manager. In 1998, I made a career change moving from the Environmental Industry to the Petroleum Industry where I started working for Mobil Oil Company in Beaumont Texas.  I have been for ExxonMobil for 22 years and have enjoyed positions in Manufacturing Operations, Laboratory Management, Sales and Marketing, Product Technology and currently Product Research and Development.      ",I received my B.S. Degree in Chemistry.  I knew by my sophomore year in high school that I would study Chemistry in college and finally make my career in the chemical industry.  The more time I invested in learning Chemistry the more I began to realize it would become a sustainable interest leading to a long-term career.     ,"I chose SEMO because I was very familiar with the University already and it felt like home to me.  Although not raised in Southeast Missouri, my parents were both from Jackson and Cape Girardeau and I spent much time as a child going to watch the SEMO (Indians at the that time) athletic events while visiting Grandparents, Aunts and Uncles.  My Dad, along with Two Uncles all three played football for the Indians while two Aunts also attended Southeast Missouri State. I would continue the family legacy.","Simply enough it was my parents.  I wanted to make them proud, to give something back to them for all of the love and support they had given to me.  I couldn't think of a better way to accomplish that than to make something of myself.  SEMO gave me that opportunity, I made good on it, and have never looked back.  31 years later, with almost a full career behind me now, I realize how important that acceptance letter from Southeast Missouri State.  That opportunity has allowed me to grow personally and professionally and travel the world. ","I have a lot of good memories of my 4 years attending Southeast Missouri St. way too many to mention.  However, one memory stands out as a real highlight for me.  It was September 18, 1988 where 7500 people would arrive to the Show-Me Center to watch President Ronald Reagan speak.  Being there in that moment was a huge thrill for me and I was in the front row.  I was so into his speech that towards the end of his speech I couldn't contain that excitement and as he finished his sentence I yelled at the top of my voice ""GO WIN ONE FOR THE GIPPER!"" - a line taken from the movie ""Knute Rockne"" where Ronald Reagan starred as legendary Notre Dame Football Coach George Gipp.   The place went silent, he looked at me and said ""You don't know how much that warms my heart""  the Show-Me Center erupted and I was famous for 1 week.  That event made a lasting impression on me.",I consider my greatest professional accomplishments being able to take a product concept all the way through development and ultimately commercialization.  That is an incredible feeling.  ,"I would say I learned that opportunity is a chance at something you place a lot of personal value in. It is not a guarantee.  To take an opportunity and convert it to a successful outcome is where the hard work resides.  There are times you will take a half step backwards, two steps sideways to go three steps forward. Stay patience, persistence, and dedicated to your cause success will follow.  That has proved to be a valuable strategy in my career and personal life. ","Opportunity, Breadth, Value","Don't be afraid to take opportunities that may move you in slightly different directions through out your career.  The most valued employees will always be those who are willing to step out of their known expertise to learn the other areas of their business such as short term stints in Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing.  In my case, this type of career path has proven to be a major differentiator and has helped me to become a highly valued employee.

I have done almost everything in between, but really that set me up for more success now that I'm at point B. I graduated in 2013 and immediately moved to St.Louis and picked up a great job in property management. The exact opposite of what I really wanted to do, what I went to school to do. While there I found ways to sneak art and creativity daily into my job. Out of the blue an opportunity for my partner back in Cape Girardeau opened up, and we moved back with almost no notice. After 3 months back in Cape working yet another job that had little to nothing to do with my interests a position became available at The Arts Council of Southeast Missouri. Upon applying I was offered a part time position. Recently the full-time Exhibitions Coordinator position opened up and after application and a fun interview process I was offered the position. ","I was a B.F.A. major at Southeast. I knew from day one I would be in the art department, and I knew from day one that I wanted to be a sculptor. I wasn't expecting to get involved in much else but I was pleasantly surprised at how much my passions grew outside of the small scope I had envisioned. The faculty in the department really helped to broaden my interests and lead me to grow a passion for the gallery and curation aspect of the art world. ","I chose to attend Southeast initially for the obvious reasons: it was close to home, it was my fathers alma mater and it made sense financially. More importantly though, I chose to stay at Southeast because of the faculty and mentorship that the art department fosters here.","Hands down my biggest influence, and professional inspiration was Chris Wubbena. The first day of my first entry level art course I moved to the ground to work while my peers sat at their desk and Wubbena walked by and said ""your a sculpture major"" and that immediate connection really set the pace for my entire academic career at Southeast. He was, and still is, the outside perspective I seek out when making decisions and his career has always been an inspiration and benchmark to my own career goals. ",My favorite memory at Southeast is Fort Serena. There is an annual event where the Sculpture and Painting students takeover Serena Hall and create a unique showcase of their work. Our year we decided to do something weirder than ever done before. We turned the woodshop into a giant blanket fort. We hung sheets from floor to ceiling and brought a projector in and lived out all of our treehouse meets classroom dreams. We called it Fort Serena. ,"My great professional accomplishment is the successful launch of my own public art project, The Public Domain Project. With the help and support of the community in Cape Girardeau, The Public Domain Project offers original artist editions monthly for free through the use of retired newspaper dispensers. This project has been the perfect blend of art and arts administration that the Southeast art department set me up to pursue. It has been highlighted in local magazine Flourish as well as The Scout Podcast. ",The most important thing I learned while at Southeast was the importance of creative flexibility. If this past year has taught us anything its that nothing ever goes according to plan. The ability to walk into a situation and have to change direction without warning is something I was be forever grateful to Southeast for. ,Creative. Energetic. Supportive. ,"There are 3 huge things that you have to be prepared for in any creative field: Be ready to hear no (alot). Ask the question. Be comfortable doing things that make you uncomfortable. Every day there are situations that are some combination of those 3 things, and being able to do them successfully makes you a stronger professional creative.

Lake Dr.,,Edwardsville,IL,62025,United States,O'Toole Design Associates,Interior Designer,"In High School I worked for a small Residential Design firm, that experience only affirmed my love for Interior Design. Fast forward to my Junior year of college, the Interior Design department at SEMO requires each student to complete an internship program prior to graduation to gain experience. My internship was with O'Toole Design Associates in St. Louis, MO. I loved every second of that summer. I was learning and being challenged every day that I stepped into the office. O'Toole then extended my summer intern position to a winter intern position and finally to a job offer after I graduated. I have now been at my job for 6 months and my excitement for my job has not faded, if anything, it has grown. In about a year and a half I will have the opportunity to take (and hopefully pass) several accreditations and move up to Interior Designer II status. ","After watching hundreds of episodes of ""Extreme Makeover Home Edition"" on ABC as a child, it was my dream to be an Interior Designer. All throughout my childhood and education I was very involved in art and design. That led me to pursue a degree in Interior Design in Fall of 2016. Additionally, I minored in Marketing and Architectural Design.","After 11 unhappy college visits, a family friend recommended I visit SEMO. I was very reluctant because of my experiences on the other 11 visits but my mom insisted we give SEMO a shot. After my Show Me day, I remember turning to my mom in the UC parking lot and telling her we didn't have to look any more because this is where I wanted to go. SEMO had every single thing on my Wishlist. I am SO thankful for that day because it was the beginning of the best days of my life.","My professors influenced me the most during my time at Southeast. Some of my favorite and most influential include my advisor and professor, Michelle Brune, Morgan Campbell, Carol Nessler, Brian Bowers, Joni Hand, and Joel Rhodes. I truly enjoyed every single one of their courses because of their extraordinary teaching.","It is absolutely impossible to nail down one BEST memory because I had a lot of bests here. One of my favorites though was when my sorority, Alpha Delta Pi, and our partner Sigma Chi won Homecoming. I was homecoming chair and had spent the last month working harder than I ever thought I could. The day of Homecoming made it all worth it.","I have only been in the field for 6 months but in that time, my greatest accomplishment was being the designer on my company's new office design!","While at SEMO, I learned so many things but the most important thing I learned was who I am as a person. I became independent, driven, confident and open-minded in the four years I was at SEMO.","Inspiring, Exciting, Home",DO IT! This is your sign!

I now am co-owner of Mended Earth Studio and create textile and surface pattern designs, illustrate coloring books, and work on commissions.  I have also had many solo and group exhibitions featuring my painting and sculpture artworks.  ",I originally studied Computer Science with an Art Minor and realized that I was more interested in Art.  I had so many interests in different artistic methods that I ultimately chose Sculpture because I could incorporate many types of art forms inside of my sculptures and/or installations.  ,"I lived in the Southeast Missouri region at the time and I had taken some Southeast dual credit courses as a high school student.  I go an Associate of Arts at Three Rivers Community College, and this was transferrable as an incoming non-traditional student.  This allowed me to focus on my degree program.  ","I was most influenced by my sculpture professor Chris Wubbena, my painting professor, Justin Henry Miller, and my fibers professor Caroline Kahler.

As part of this assignment, I applied for a Financial Aid Specialist position with SEMO and interviewed with the University in October 2013, right before my graduation. Shortly before my undergraduate commencement, my new supervisor called and said, ""Merry Christmas and Happy Graduation from Southeast Missouri State University. We're offering you the job."" After a promotion, it's now my 8th year with the University where I work in Student Financial Services. During my time working for SEMO, I graduated with my MBA in Financial Management in May 2019. I love serving students and have gained valuable experience working alongside staff members who previously handled my financial aid when I was a student. ","My undergraduate program was Bachelor of General Studies and a Minor in Management. My Graduate program was MBA in Financial Management. I consider the business program at Southeast a challenging program that prepares business students for real-life in a business work environment. I learned valuable skills for data mining and database management during my studies, among many other things such as strategic decision making and international finance. ",I chose to attend Southeast because it was close to home to visit family but still far enough away that I could build my independence. ,"My supervisor at Southeast after graduating with my undergraduate degree was my mentor. She believed in me, took me under her wing, and when she retired I was hired into her position. She inspired me by her strong morals and faith, and this gave me strength and encouragement while I was pursuing my graduate program.  I think it's important for growth to both have a mentor and to have someone to mentor.

Southeast challenged me to think outside the box and to not give up. ","Diverse, Resilient, Determined ","For students pursuing a career in financial management or financial aid, I would advise students to never get too comfortable with how things currently are because the business world is constantly changing.

After graduation, I did a summer internship in HR with Summit Distributing. Then I worked for a ground-floor insurance company as their HR Manager for about a year.  After that, I started working in HR at Lindbergh Schools and have been here for the last several years.  I also am the Head Coach of the high school Cheerleading team at Lindbergh and absolutely love getting to the opportunity to work both in HR and Cheer! ","My major was Business Administration with an emphasis in Human Resources Management. I loved the program. I felt like I learned so much about HR during college that was actually useful to me in my different jobs. Obviously, there were a few courses I was not quite as fond of that I had to take for the Business degree, but overall, I felt like I left feeling decently prepared to work in an entry-level HR setting. ","I chose to attend Southeast for several reasons. One reason was the proximity to home (St. Louis). Also, my college tour really sealed the deal for me. I was very impressed with the HR program, but above that, when I met with the Dean of the HR Program (Dr. Kevin Dickson), he ended up walking my mom and I over to the Rec Center since our tour had not covered that. I was blown away with the sincerity and kindness he showed me. I knew then that Southeast would be a place that felt like home. ","I think the person that influenced me the most during my time at Southeast was my cheer coach, Kodie Edmonds. I was so honored to be part of the cheerleading team at SEMO and learned so much about myself, life skills, and cheerleading from her. She pushed us to be great, but also made genuine relationships with us. As I look back, I realize how many things I do now in my work life or as a coach that are because of the values she instilled in me as a college athlete. ","I think my best college memory is being on the cheerleading team. That experience was unlike anything else and was truly the best time of my life. Cheerleading is my passion in this world and being able to say that I was a collegiate cheerleader means the world to me. I was so lucky to be able to experience things such as college game day, campus events/performances, team bonding and making new friends, open gyms, and those tough practices that push you to become better and achieve greatness. ","I was part of the SEMO Cheerleading Team and that has been the best experience of my life. Being a collegiate athlete was a commitment. We had to succeed in school, weight train, practice, and cheer at games. The life skills I leaned from being on this team are invaluable. I learned how to have a team mentality, knowing that no one makes it by on their own and that we are all necessary to achieve success. I learned how to be a leader, how to have confidence, how to work hard and go above and beyond, how to manage my time and priorities, how to deal with conflict, and so much more. Being a cheerleader allowed me to be the best version of myself and 100% believe if I were not involved with this team at SEMO that I would not be the same person I am today.","I think the most important thing I learned while at Southeast was how much bigger the world is than what I thought. I feel like I was able to meet so many different types of people and learn things I wouldn't have otherwise just by being at SEMO.  I feel like I learned how to be more open minded and more accepting of others who are different from me, which is so important. I really think SEMO allowed me an opportunity to grow into a better person overall. ",Setup for success,"I would suggest that you try to get internships and experience in any way you can.

I was ultimately responsible for designing interfaces for the new Air Force One fleet of aircraft, systems which had to be impervious to Soviet surveillance techniques.  All of my designs passed their NSA tests with perfect scores, and the technology I developed still flies on the Air Force One fleet today.  In 1989, my career took a sharp turn from the technical side towards the business side by entering the semiconductor industry as an applications engineer.   After 8 years and three companies, I co-founded Summit Microelectronics in 1997, developing the world's first programmable analog ICs.  Summit had many successes, but one I am particularly proud of was the introduction of the first USB charging chips for use in cell phones and other handheld devices, thus ushering in the era of universal charging.   Summit was preparing for an IPO in 2012 when Qualcomm acquired our company.  The Summit division of Qualcomm invented the Quick Charge fast-charging technology which is used on 90% of Android devices worldwide today.  I left Qualcomm in 2018 and have recently formed a new company, EnScientia, LLC, which promotes the integrity of scientific research.","I was a physics major at SEMO.   I can only characterize the quality of education I received as excellent.   I must admit I was somewhat intimidated upon hiring into my first job out of school along with recent graduates from the likes of Texas AandM, Texas, Oklahoma State, and Mizzou.  I quickly discovered that I could hold my own, and that my education at SEMO had provided applicable knowledge my peers did not possess.","My father taught there, and I was very familiar with the institution.","The late Dr. Robert Freeman, in my major, and the late Robert N. Cox, advisor, as a mentor.","There are many to choose from, but I will count this one as the best because it was the first:  As a senior in high school at Cape Girardeau central, I enrolled for some classes at SEMO, including Astronomy 101 in the fall semester with Dr. Leo Connelly, whom I already knew.   Dr. Connelly named me the Astronomy lab assistant for the spring semester.  When the students learned their lab assistant was a ""high school kid"" they were taken aback and were a bit disrespectful to me.   I earned their confidence and their trust over the course of the semester, and made several friends along the way.","I was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, holding four offices including President.   I was also a member and President of the Society of Physics Students.   I was named to the Alpha Council my senior year, and was a semi-finalist for SEMO Man-of-the-Year.   In PiKA I learned leadership and interpersonal skills that have served me well throughout my entire career.","The value of a well-rounded education.   Success in life only starts with what you know, but needs to be augmented with the ability to apply that knowledge.  Or, put another way, the ability to get things done.   One starts with a good idea, but he or she must be able to communicate that idea to others, be open to new information and viewpoints (including criticism), and be able to negotiate differences towards a viable end goal.

98,DONALD,BERRY,dberryprofishing@msn.com,1989,5841 W ALEXA LANE,,SPRINGFIED,Missouri,65802,United States,RETIRED,Retired Assistant Superintendent / Pro Angler / Radio Show Host,"AI started my educational career after graduating from Advanced High School and entering college at the University of the Ozarks where I played basketball from 1967-1971.  I started my career after graduation as a Coach in the Carter County R-1 in Van Buren, MO.  I retired as baseball coach with an undefeated regular season record in 1975.  I continued as men's basketball coach and retired in 1978 with an undefeated regular season at 27-0, losing our only game in the State Sectionals in Springfield, MO on a last second shot.  I moved on to Administration and spent from m1978 to 1987 as High School Principal at Van Buren.  In 1987 I moved to Willard High School where I served as Principal until moving to the Central Office as Assistant Superintendent where I retired in 2002.  After retirement from the public school system, I worked for Edison Schools of New York and STI in Alabama for several years.  I have always fished tournaments and in 2000 had the opportunity to start a radio show which talked with local, regional and professional anglers across the country.  In 2002 I was inducted into the Willard High School Hall of Fame for being the ""Voice"" of the Willard Tigers, starting the Four State Classic and Fishing.  In 2021, the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame inducted me into their second class of Outdoor Sports for Fishing and Media.  I continue to fish competitively and spend my spare time watching my beloved grandpups play basketball. ",1979 Masters in Education :  This degree kicked off my career as a high school counselor.  I had tremendous training at SEMO during my journey toward being a counselor.  1989 Specialist Degree in Education:  This degree pushed me into the field of school administration and I served at Van Buren High School and Willard High School as a Secondary Principal.  I later moved to the Central Office Administration as the Assistant Superintendent.  I was lucky that all my instructors worked with me and taught things about the positions that I would successfully hold until 2002,"It was the closest University is driving distance from Van Buren, MO and I had relatives in and near Advance, MO where I graduated high school.  It was the only University that I was familiar with.","All the professors that I encountered during my education at SEMO who took the time to share experiences that I never thought I would encounter, but soon appreciated all that the department instructors shared with me.",I enjoyed the companionship of students who I attended class with and the communication between faculty and students. One summer I played intramural softball and that was exciting. ,,You earn everything in life and very few things come to you unless you reach out and grab the ring as it comes by.,Exceptional educational experience!!!,"Although I spent 30 years in the educational field and cherish each and every student that I had, I really believe that being the host on a radio show that promotes fishermen and angling activities has opened more doors for me than I could have expected.  I have continued to fish professionally and earned recognition through the media.  I utterly enjoyed education and the kids, but there is no comparison to the ""tug on the end of the line"" or getting a Pro angler to share his fishing secrets.

I was also offered a chemistry graduate assistantship along with my offer at Southeast. apart from pursuing MNS in chemistry I also teach two of my own general chemistry laboratories for incoming freshman students. I recently got accepted to the University of Kansas for their Ph.D. program in fall 2021, so my future goal would be to complete my Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry to become a professor and teach chemistry to potential students to achieve their goals ","My major at southeast was ACS approved Chemistry.  I have encountered with few things I think would have impacted on the quality. the first is very talented Faculty. I have had connections with almost every faculty in chemistry department and I can say without any doubt that I am one of the lucky ones. they are very talented and welcoming. one thing I notice in our department than any other is that our professors doors are always open for students. the other things is the facilities. we have numerous amount of very expensive/ useful chemistry instrumentation here which will allow you to work on cutting edge research with our talented faculties. the final one I want to point out here is the number of organizations. we have numerous amount of student organizations for prospective students in our department including American Chemical Society Student Chapter, John Stephan Honors society etc:.  ",SEMO is higher in ranking in diversity. and specially the department and the faculty there are very welcoming.,My current thesis mentor Dr. Shaner Sarah. ,I was a member in American Chemical Society(ACS) Student Chapter and one of the million exciting things we did in their was to attend ACS national conference where you get to present your research and get to make conversations with worlds most famous scientists. one of the major pros comes along with this opportunity is that the chance you get to explore new citifies along with science. ,I was able to travel and explore what I love the most(science) when I was in ACS student chapter in SEMO. it actually helped me to make connections with greatest people including scientists. I was able to see how science applies to real world. not just that I also was able to make very valuable friends in my life through these opprtunities.

Then the following years after that would be Mr. Tony Faber and Dr. Sarah Kuborn! They were always there for me and to help me! ,There’s quite a lot to pick from. I think my favorite one though is all the lunch dates my older brother and I had throughout my freshman year. We’d get lunch once or twice a week and catch up on each other’s life.

PhD in International Conflict Management is the only such programs available in North America. This program is very competitive in terms of selecting the applicants. PhD students accepted into the program receive broad interdisciplinary training and opportunities that draw on an array of academic disciplines. My area of research is concentrated into Nepal’s relationship with its Neighboring Countries and role of law in settling international disputes. This will also research on Kalapni-Lipulekh issue that that took place last year between Nepal and India. Further, the paper will research on Nepal-USA and Nepal-China relationship. Some of the areas my paper will focus are Treaty Law, State responsibility, International peace and security, Peaceful settlement of international disputes, Diplomatic and consular law, United Nations institutions and law making, International human rights law, and International criminal law.  I am the first generation of my family to earn this highest academic level. I am also planning to continue my master’s M.S. in International Conflict Management. This will be my third master’s degree. I completed my first master’s degree from Southeast Missouri State University in Master of Science in Criminal Justice, and second master’s degree Master of Laws from Washburn University School of Law. I was also recognized as Pro Bono Honor from Washburn Law. Last year, I planned to pursue my PhD from University of Kent, Canterbury, England but due to Global Pandemic the program got postponed for that year. Since, the PhD in International Conflict Management is a very competitive program, I spend more of my time in preparing the best proposal for being accepted in this program. Currently, I am working at Cole and Moore, P.S.C. Attorneys-at-Law. I am working on the Real Estate, Criminal Defense, and Family Immigration Department.  My long term goal is to work in the area of criminal law and international law. I will be focusing on the individual criminal responsibility for crimes like sexual assault and battery, aggravated stalking, kidnapping, false imprisonment, homicide, and international crimes, such as war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and aggression. This PhD degree is the goal where I can test my knowledge that I gained from different school throughout this time.","My major at Southeast was Criminal Justice. The reason behind doing this course was to understand the American system of law enforcement, courts, prisons, counseling services, and other organizations and agencies that people come into contact with on a daily basis. I was always curious to know what strategies are applied to prevent crime and to create a peaceful, law-abiding society. Some classes were very helpful to understand the psychological and sociological mindset of the people that later turns them out to be a criminal. Another reason behind this study was to understand the Death Penalty System of the United States. Since capital punishment in Nepal has been abolished under the country's common law, I was always eager to understand how the capital punishment is viewed by the United States. The course helped me to explore the debate that raised on the validity of capital punishment and why the longer trials and appeals are required when a person's life is on the line. I was able to understand the need for more lawyers and experts on both sides of the case, and the relative rarity of executions makes the capital punishment expensive. The program was very helpful to turn my professional career in a good direction.","The reason behind choosing Southeast was because the faculty members were very helpful to review my documents to get accepted for the program. While I was in Nepal I got an opportunity to chat with my Advisor over the phone and she explained me about the course and its importance to let me decide whether it would be suitable for my long-term goal. Later, I got appointed as a Graduate Assistant (GA) at Counseling and Disability Services and worked under Campus Violence Prevention Program. I got full Scholarship that minimized my financial stress. My work as a GA helped me to understand the administrative stuffs and learn office etiquette. I still remember how nervous and shy I was during the first few weeks of the school. Southeast really helped me to overcome my weakness and focus on my strength. Whenever I recall back to my time at Southeast, I will always feel fortunate to make the decision to choose southeast. ","My Advisor Dr. Michelle Kilburn and Professor Dr. Carl Kinnison are the two important people from the faculty who influenced the most during my time at Southeast. Besides the faculty. Ms. Torie Grogran, Former Director of Counseling and Disability Services, and  Ms. Donna St. Sauver, Coordinator of Campus Violence Prevention Program are two important people of my life from Southeast. During the first few weeks as a GA I was not very confident in during class presentation and speaking in front of people. As English being the second language, and due to cultural differences I was very nervous and was having difficulty in opening up myself. There were several other challenges that came across like communication, difficulty in understanding the lectures, academic writing, and social skills. These people helped me the most to bring the best out of me. Similarly, I got to make some really good friends at Southeast.","The best college memory is the 2019 Meeting of the Minds regional conference in Kansas City, Missouri. This was the time when I made a best memories with the student organization Redhawk Health Educator (a student group of certified peer educator). Additionally, I got an opportunity to present a session on the use of technology, videos and interactive strategies to inform students about alcohol use, bystander intervention and consent. I explained about the advantage of the technology to educate students about the responsible use of alcohol.   Some other college memory includes End of Semester party at Sara Wagner's (Former Assistant Director of Fitness and Wellness) house and outreach event named ""The Clothesline Project"" organized by Campus Violence Prevention Program.

","My major at Southeast was Chemistry with a focus in chemistry and biochemistry. I really enjoyed the chemistry program because of the many areas of focus within it. I learned many things in my lecture and lab classes that help me be successful at my job. The professors in the department were great. They were very passionate about what they teach, and that made the classes enjoyable. The professors invest in their students and want them to succeed. ","I attended Southeast because of the variety of degree options to choose from, the programs available to students to get involved, and because I was close to family. ","Dr. Crawford and Joanna Shaver were two people who greatly impacted my college career.  Dr. Crawford taught many of my chemistry classes, was my advisor, and gave me the opportunity of working as a lab assistant during my time at SEMO. He allowed me to grow my passion for chemistry in his classroom by the way he taught and cared about the success of his students. He gave us every opportunity to succeed. Dr. Crawford helped me find internships and figure out where I wanted to take my career. He was a big factor in why I stuck with chemistry throughout college.  Joanna Shaver was the advisor for Student Activities Council (SAC). I joined partway through my first semester and was given the opportunity to work backstage at a conference for the organization, where I set up stages for various performances such as bands, magicians, comedians, poets, and more. Coming back from the trip, I got more involved and became an officer, holding positions throughout my 4 years and attending more conferences. Joanna gave me the opportunity to plan campus wide events for students to get involved while at Southeast. She helped me get outside of my comfort zone. I really enjoyed working with Joanna. She helped me in so many ways throughout college. ","College was an amazing experience. The best part about it was living on campus. I made some great friends while living in towers. One of my favorite memories of college was living on the same floor as some of my friends. The fire alarm goes off occasionally in towers, and one of those times was during finals week. I had just gotten back to the dorm after studying for my finals at the library and everyone was filing out. I found my friends as we waited, but we didn’t know how long we would have to wait. It was freezing and the library had hot chocolate, so we decided to hike back to the library. It was the middle of the night and everyone was half asleep and we come strolling into the library with pajamas on. College is a whole different world and it’s great. It was something I’ll never forget. ","During my time at SEMO, I was part of Student Activities Council (SAC), Alpha Chi Sigma (chemistry fraternity), and the Honors Program.  In SAC, I became an officer my freshman year. I learned to plan campus wide events, network with agents to book performers, and work with a team to plan a wide variety of events. I attended many conferences with SAC where I saw a variety of performances and interactive events that I would potentially bring to campus. I learned many skills through SAC such as event planning, coordinating with people, and advertising.  In Alpha Chi Sigma, I met so many people who also had a passion for science. Joining a chemistry fraternity helped me connect with students and professors in my degree field outside of the classroom. We helped each other in classes or had many get together to have fun. Alpha Chi Sigma kept me passionate about what I chose to study.  Through the Honors Program, I was able to work on various projects to further my knowledge in different classes. I was able to apply to choose projects to learn more about a particular area I was interested in. I was given opportunities to present research at conferences and show people what I had accomplished. I could also just hang out at the honors house and go to events that they had. I met some great people there. ","The most important thing I learned while at SEMO was to take every opportunity you can. This is a great time to find who you are and what you enjoy doing. I went to as many events as I could because I didn’t want to miss out on anything. Because I went to SEMO, I studied abroad, I went on multiple trips with organizations I was involved in, I had 2 internships, I met some famous people, I found new hobbies, and I made some great friendships along the way. Get involved and make the most of college and life!  ","Home, inclusive, hilly",My advice to current students or recent graduates would be to get an internship or do research with a professor. These things were a big factor in the direction I chose to take my career. Internships give you a glimpse of what a job within a company would be like and if it’s something you could see yourself doing. It also gives you experience in a setting other than a classroom in your interested field. Research gives you the chance to dig deeper into something you want to learn more about. You won’t know if you like a career until you test it out. ,https://semo.wufoo.com/cabinet/a493396c-9262-4f93-82a9-0b3bccefc170,5/2/2021 3:16,public,,,174.255.132.95,1,1
